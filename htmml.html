                    <p>Modern computers use microchips, solid state drives and other cheaper alternatives to vacuum tubes.
                        Vacuum tubes mostly rely on thermionic emission of electrons from a hot filament or a cathode heated
                        by the filament. A vacuum tube consists of two or more electrodes in a vacuum within an airtight enclosure.
                        Most tubes have glass envelopes, though ceramic and metal envelopes (atop insulating bases) have been used.
                        The electrodes are attached to leads which extend through the envelope via an airtight seal. Most
                        vacuum tubes possess a limited lifetime, due to the filament or heater burning out or other failure modes.

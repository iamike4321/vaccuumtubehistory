                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>Modern computers use microchips, solid state drives and other cheaper alternatives to vacuum tubes.
                        Vacuum tubes mostly rely on thermionic emission of electrons from a hot filament or a cathode heated
                        by the filament. A vacuum tube consists of two or more electrodes in a vacuum within an airtight enclosure.
                        Most tubes have glass envelopes, though ceramic and metal envelopes (atop insulating bases) have been used.
                        The electrodes are attached to leads which extend through the envelope via an airtight seal. Most
                        vacuum tubes possess a limited lifetime, due to the filament or heater burning out or other failure modes.
                    </p>
                    <h2>How it started</h2>
                    <p> Many scientists and inventors who experimented with such tubes include Thomas Edison, Eugen
                        Goldstein, Nikola Tesla, and Johann Wilhelm Hittorf. With the exception of early light bulbs,
                        such tubes were only used in scientific research or as novelties. The groundwork laid by these
                        scientists and inventors, however, was critical to the development of subsequent vacuum tube technology.
                    </p>
                    <h2>When it was implemented</h2>
                    <p>The earliest vacuum tubes evolved from incandescent light bulbs, containing a filament sealed in
                        an evacuated glass envelope. The current can only pass in one direction such a diode will convert
                        alternating current AC to pulsating DC. Diodes can therefore be used in a DC power supply, of
                        amplitude modulated.</p>
                    <h2>How is now</h2>
                    <p>Since their reliability in not the greatest they are not widely utilized in modern devices. The
                        cathode ray tube which is used in 1950â€™s television sets is a 21st century usage of vacuum tubes.
                        The modern vacuum tubes are no longer being in use in today's society.
